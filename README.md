# DOOM Playdate port

Based on PureDOOM. OPL emulation from Chocolate Doom.

## Building

This port is written for the Playdate C SDK version 2.0.3, but newer versions
should work as well. Build using `make`.

## Playing

DOOM will crash if no WAD files are found. For your convenience, the shareware
version of DOOM is bundled with this port. You can add other WAD files into the
game's data folder by mounting your Playdate in "data disk" mode. See
[this guide](https://help.play.date/games/sideloading/#data-disk-mode)
to learn how. You will find the game's data folder at
PLAYDATE/Data/me.spazzylemons.doom.
